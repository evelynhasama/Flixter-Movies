### Notes
Most of the challenges in creating additional features to the Flixter Movies app came from adding a bonus element. Adding the Web Kit View to my app, along with the neccessary code to properly load the correct page took a lot of trial and error. Ultimately, I was able to accomplish this task, and I am excited to take on more bonus features in the projects that lie ahead.

### Notes
With the new updates to Xcode, I did have difficulties creating the new App file with the correct properties. I faced a few challenges with my terminal and initializing pod; however, the problems were solved. I really enjoyed making this app, and I am excited to make more in the future building off what I learned in creating this one.
